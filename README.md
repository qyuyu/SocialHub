# SocialHub: A Social Networking Web App

- Designed and implemented features with React for users to create, browse, and search nearby posts.
- Improved the authentication using JWT token-based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4.
- Utilized GCS to maintain user-uploaded pictures/videos and Elasticsearch to optimize search functions such that users can search recent posts and list personal posts.
- Developed the backend services in Go and deployed to Google Cloud for better scalability and reliability.
